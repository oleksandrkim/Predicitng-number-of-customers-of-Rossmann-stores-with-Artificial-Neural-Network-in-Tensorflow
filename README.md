# Predicitng-number-of-customers-of-Rossmann-stores-with-Artificial-Neural-Network-in-Tensorflow
The structure of this network is literally the same as the structure of a neural network that processes the same dataset with Keras (repository: https://github.com/oleksandrkim/Predicitng-sales-and-number-of-customers-of-Rossmann-stores-with-Artificial-Neural-Network-in-Keras). <br> **It is a "mimic" of keras model but done in tensorflow.** <br>
It's not completed entirely
